#    account from any and all lists.
# => Chimpactions will fail gracefully (i.e. not try to send) on any varibles
#    either not set by your model, or not in the particular list.
# => If your model does not respond_to?('your_models_attribute_or_method')
#    the merge variable will be skipped (not sent).
