h2. Usage

h3. What's available

Once defined (in chimpactions.yml) the local Rails model inherits the following methods from the Chimpactions gem :
* add_to(List)
* move_to(List)
* remove_from(List)

h3. A Chimpaction :

*WHENN (A model method/attribute) IS (<,>,=) VALUE, ACTION (Chimpactions method) LIST (One of your MailChimp Lists)*

ex.

 'When a user has more than 50 posts, move them to the Power Poster list'

*_in chimpactions.yml_*
<pre><code>
  action:
    -
    action: :move_to,
    list: Power Posters,
    whenn: posts.count,
    is: >,
    value: 50
    -
 </code>
</pre>

*_for ActiveRecord store_* 
 The admin interface should be a straightforward representation. 

h3. Administrative Interface

Direct your browser to http://yourapp.chimpactions for a simple CRUD to build and manage Actions.
Available values are set in the forms where applicable, validations will tell you if a value won't work.

h3. Manual access

You can move subscribers around arbitrarily as well:

<code>User.remove_from("Power Posters") </code>
